# DroneSLAM-ArduPilot
This repository explores the simulation of a drone navigating an unknown environment while performing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using ArduPilot. The project aims to enhance autonomous drone capabilities by integrating SLAM techniques, enabling real-time mapping and localization in uncharted spaces.
